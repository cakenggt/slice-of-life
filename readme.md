* All empty blocks will be made into air.
* `Type`: `solid` means solid, anything else means it is a non-solid block.
* `Specular`: `rough` means not goal, anything else means it is a goal block.
* Export as Link, make sure `resize to bounding box` is unchecked,then paste into `map.troxelLink` as a string
